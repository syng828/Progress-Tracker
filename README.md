# Progress-Tracker
Android app that allows you to select files and create subjects, topics, and questions. You can check if your answers are correct, and it will give you a progress bar. 

Java concepts include OOP concepts (classes, interfaces) and serialization
Android concepts include RecyclerView among other UI concepts. 

This was built upon my previous repository, progressChecker that is purely made in Java.
