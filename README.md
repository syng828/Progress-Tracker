# Progress-Tracker
Android app that allows you to select files and create subjects, topics, and questions. There is a progress bar for each topic that allows you to check your progress depending on how many questions you answered correctly. 

Java concepts include OOP concepts (classes, interfaces) and serialization of files. 
Android concepts include RecyclerView among other UI concepts. 

This was built upon my previous repository, progressChecker made only in Java. This project was made to gain a better understanding about how objects interact with user input.
