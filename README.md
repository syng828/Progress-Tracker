# Progress-Tracker
This android app allows you to easily track your progress in school among various subjects. Customize your own subjects, seperate them into topics, and put in some questions all on your own! 

Technical concepts: 
- Java: Used to store information into classes. 
- Android Studio: Used to make UI (includes concepts such as RecyclerView)

This was built upon my previous repository, progressChecker made only in Java. This project was made to gain a better understanding about how objects interact with user input.
